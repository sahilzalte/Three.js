# We Make Good Shit....

Dogstudio is a multidisciplinary creative studio at the intersection of art, design and technology. This project is a digital playground where we explore the boundaries of immersive experiences through code.

## The Vision
In this workspace, we aren't just building a website; we're crafting an emotional journey. Using Three.js and Vite, we manipulate the canvas to deliver amazing experiences that make people talk.

## The Tech Stack
- **Three.js**: Our brush for the digital canvas.
- **Vite**: The engine that keeps our experiments lightning-fast.
- **Pure Emotion**: The core dependency of every Dogstudio project.

## Getting Started
To witness the magic, follow these steps:

1. **Install the soul of the project**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Ignite the experience**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Our Philosophy
We believe in the power of beauty and the elegance of code. Every line in `main.js` is a step toward an immersive reality. We don't just solve problems; we move people.
